Goals: 
- Make good visualizations fitting the spirit of the song. 
    - More than just a one-trick-pony: Many Visualizations have just one type of visualization which leads to music being defined by the visualizer and not the other way around.
    - A little bit of randomness: The visualization should be to some degree predictable to give a good picture of the music. But if it is 100% predictable, it can quickly become boring.
- Optimized for an LED-Strip (1-dimensional, additive color(?))


Ideas:
- Phases: Can we divide the song globally in parts? Do we need to?

- While Beat-Phase, beats do steps through a color scheme, in other phases the spectrum should have more influence on color
